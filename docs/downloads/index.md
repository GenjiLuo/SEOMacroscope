## PLATFORMS

**SEO Macroscope** is developed on Windows. Currently, tested on Windows 7 and 10 with the .NET 4.5.2 framework.
{: .lead }

Macintosh users, with the Mono framework and Xamarin IDE installed, *may* be able to compile and run the project. I do not currently plan on making a native port to Macintosh.
