This will hopefully be the final beta of SEO Macroscope before I bump the version number to 1.0. Source code and an installer can be found on GitHub at:

* [https://github.com/nazuke/SEOMacroscope/releases/tag/v0.9.0.4b](https://github.com/nazuke/SEOMacroscope/releases/tag/v0.9.0.4b)

Please check the [downloads page]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }}) for more recent versions.

I've spent most of the time cleaning up bugs, tuning features, and tidying up the displays.

## Features added include:

* Logging and reporting of relative/absolute URLs used in pages.
* Support and detection of text-based sitemaps.
* Cosmetic enhancements in overview and document details panels.
* Added Remarks report, for arbitrary problems discovered during a crawl.
* Implemented support for inline CSS processing, to find links to external CSS assets.
* Query strings may now be ignored.

There are still a few bugs, such as the calculation of duplicate titles; but I'm finding that this is becoming pretty useful in daily work.
