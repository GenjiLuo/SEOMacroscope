This release of SEO Macroscope includes support for automatic language detection of title, description, and content in your web pages and PDFs, where possible.

Chiefly, this is another tool to help identify problems with multilingual websites. For example, to detect content that is in the wrong language for a particular site.

Please check the [downloads page]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }}) for more recent versions.

This release has some improvements in terms of display speed, and the user interface.

From time to time, memory may be exhausted. I've been working on strategies to try and avoid this.

I've also fixed some minor bugs.

## Features added include:

* Automatic language detection, where possible, of title and description meta tags, and the page content. This function applies to both web pages, and to PDFs when PDF processing is enabled.
