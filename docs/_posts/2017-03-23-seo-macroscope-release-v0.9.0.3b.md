Please check the [downloads page]({{ "/downloads/" | relative_url }}) for more recent versions.

I've reworked the tracking of linked documents, and hyperlinks across the crawled collection.

More details may be found in the release notes.

Next, I plan on writing the rest of the manual, and work towards a version 1.0 release.

This version, however, seems to be firming up to be pretty useful for everyday work. So far, it's been helping me to find rogue branding on my company's site, amongst other things.
