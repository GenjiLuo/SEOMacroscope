The default preferences are set to enable modest spidering of your site, but will omit attempting to download large files, will not descend into localized pages, and will not perform some of the more intense SEO analyses.

Some expensive processing options are also disabled by default, such as deep keyword analysis. Check these options, as some of them need to be enabled before crawling takes place.

Please refer to the preferences settings before beginning a spidering job.
