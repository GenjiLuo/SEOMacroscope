**This project is still very much a work-in-progress, expect lots of bugs and missing features.**

## Synopsis

SEO Macroscope is a website link checking tool, with some technical SEO functionality.

## Installation

There is no installer for SEO Macroscope ready quite yet. The C# solution may be opened and run using SharpDevelop 5 or Visual Studio; it may also compile and run using MonoDevelop.

As soon as the project has reached a suitably stable point, I shall release an installer.

Open the solution in SharpDevelop or Visual Studio, ensure that the references are satisfied, set build to **Debug**, compile and run.

## Usage

Enter the URL of the website to scan into the **Start URL** field, and then click the **Start** button.

Depending on the size and responsiveness of your website, it may take a while to complete the scan.
